# Introduction

Welcome to the Polymath CMS API! You can use our API to access Polymath API endpoints, which can get information on various contents, images, assets, data models, and leads in our database.

You can view API response examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right. PHP examples will be added soon.

Polymath uses API keys to allow access to the API. Your company account owner can give you access to retrieve, and reset this key in the [content management portal](https://app.polymathx.com).

The API expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a GET or POST that looks like the following:

`https://api.polymathx.com/?key=yourapikey`

Required Global Parameter | Description
---------- | -------
key | The API key, found in the "Company" section of your CMS portal.

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>yourapikey</code> with your personal API key, and add this parameter on ALL API requests.
